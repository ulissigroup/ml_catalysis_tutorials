    "# Adsorption energy calculations using a toy calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "A structural relaxation or structure optimization is the process of iteratively updating atom positions to find the atom positions that minimize the energy of the structure. Standard optimization methods are used in structural relaxations — below we use the Limited-Memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm. The step number, time, energy, and force max are printed at each optimization step. Each step is considered one example because it provides all the information we need to train models for the S2EF task and the entire set of steps is referred to as a trajectory. Visualizing intermediate structures or viewing the entire trajectory can be illuminating to understand what is physically happening and to look for problems in the simulation, especially when we run ML-driven relaxations. \n",

We approximate a true surface by fixing the subsurface atoms into their “bulk” locations. This ensures that they cannot move at the “bottom” of the surface. If they could, this would throw off our calculations. Consistent with the above, we fix all atoms with tags=0, and denote them as \"fixed\". All other atoms are considered \"free\"."

Although not mandatory (depending on the application), maintaining this energy-force consistency is important for models that seek to make predictions on both properties.\n",
